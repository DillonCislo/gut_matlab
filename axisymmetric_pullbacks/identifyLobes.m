%idenitfyLobes(timePoints, sphiBase, guess1, guess2, guess3, visualize) Find folds in meshes 
%   Load each spcutMesh, find the local minima in radius, and mark these as 
%   fold locations. Track the location of those local minima over time, and
%   mark fold locations before the appearance of a fold as the location
%   where it appears. The pathlength is computed from the mean centerline's
%   pathlength ('mcline'), not ringpath_ss, which uses the surface
%   pathlength.
%
% Parameters
% ----------
% timePoints : N x 1 float/int array
%   The timestamps of each file to load (1 per minute is assumed)
% sphiBase : string
% guess123 : array of 3 floats, each between 0 and 1
%   Guesses for fractional position along U of each fold
% max_wander : float
%   maximum distance a fold location can wander in a given timepoint once 
%   identified, in units of pathlength (ss)
% visualize : bool
% method : ('ringpath' or 'avgpts')
%   which method to use to find local minima, 'avgpts' recommended
% first_tp_allowed : int, default=-1
%   First timepoint in which we allow detected local minumum to be 
%   considered a true, physical fold. There may be one value for each fold
%   passed to the function, for ex [-1 -1 10] would prevent a third fold
%   from being found before t=10. 
%
% Returns
% -------
% fold_onset : #folds x 1 float
%   timestamps (not indices) of fold onset
% folds : #timepoints x #folds int
%   indices of nU sampling of folds
% ssmax : #timepoints x 1 float
%   maximum length of the centerline for each timepoint
% ssfold : #timepoints x #folds float
%   positional pathlength along centerline of folds
% rmax : #timepoints x 1 float
%   maximum radius of any part of the surface at each timepoint
%
